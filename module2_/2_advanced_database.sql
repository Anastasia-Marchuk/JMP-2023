---- REQUIREMENTS---------------
1. Design database for CDP program. Your DB should store information about students (name, surname, date of birth, phone numbers, primary skill, created_datetime, updated_datetime etc.), subjects (subject name, tutor, etc.) and exam results (student, subject, mark).
2. Please add appropriate constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, etc.).
3. Design such kind of database for PostrgeSQL. Show your design in some suitable way (PDF, PNG, etc). (1 point)
